Using this node.hPreview the document file.   Create node.cpp file to implement node.h, then create a main.cpp file to:

- Read in a file (input.txt) that has at least two lines (you can assume 2 lines).  Insert each line into a node creating single linked list (using the definitions in node.h).  Then delete the first and last lines.  Then print out the remaining list to both the screen and a file named output.txt.

Most of this information can be found in your text book, so you do not have to reinvent the wheel....just understand what you are writing.  (Names have been changed to force you to read and understand the List Toolkit listed in the textbook.)  Please use the names of member variables and member functions in the attached node.h.  For this assignment, you may use the <string> STL but please do not use other Standard Template Libraries like <vector>, or <list>.

You shouldn't have to change node.h but if you do, make sure that you document any changes.  Your main.cpp should be really quite short, and your node.cpp should be very similar to the one in the book....please don't just cut and paste...try to understand why you are writing lines of code.
