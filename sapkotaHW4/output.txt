The World Health Organization has declared the Zika 
virus an international 
public health emergency, prompted by growing 
concern that it could cause birth defects.
As many as four million people could be 
infected by the end of the year.
Officials at the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention have 
urged pregnant women against travel to about 
two dozen countries, 
mostly in the Caribbean and Latin America, 
where the outbreak is growing.
