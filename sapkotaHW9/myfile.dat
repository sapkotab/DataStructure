Safeguarding the cityâ€™s water begins with protecting land that surrounds the streams, rivers, lakes and reservoirs.

The Catskill Delaware watershed encompasses more than a million acres. The city, state and local governments and nonprofit land conservancies own 40 percent of the land.

The rest is privately owned, but development is regulated to prevent pollutants from getting into the water supply.
The city has also upgraded septic systems and wastewater treatment plants in communities around the watershed and helped build municipal salt sheds and manure sheds on dairy farms to prevent harmful runoff.
