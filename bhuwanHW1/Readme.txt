Design and implement a class that generates a sequence of pseudorandom integers described in p93 project number 11 of the textbook.

Submit header file my_random.h, implementation file my_random.cpp, main function file main.cpp that asks initial seed number, and prints three sequential numbers generated by the program. You need to include  a makefile, and  Readme file (as demo'ed in nameHW1.zip).
